## This program will tell you if the year you input is a leap year or not a leap year. 

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

'''
This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
    Leap year is every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

    **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

    **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
'''



div_by_four = year % 4
div_by_hundred = year % 100
div_by_four_hundred = year % 400

if div_by_four == 0:
    if div_by_hundred == 0:
        if div_by_four_hundred == 0:
            print("Leap year.")
        else:
            print("Not leap year.")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
