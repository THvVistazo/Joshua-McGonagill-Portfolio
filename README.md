# Joshua-McGonagill-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I am learning to code and script, please feel free to leave me recommendations or help me fix my code!


My coding experience started in college. I started learning python, which sparked my interest in computers. I now am striving to help keep businesses and the
world at large safe by coding and scripting tools that will help with vulnerability scanning, network testing and more. This portfolio is a work-in-progress.
so please keep that in mind. Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub and review my portfolio!
